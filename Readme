Consider it to be an unsteady case with the governing equation
∂T
∂t = α∇2T

Use Crank-Nicolson scheme for the time integration and 2nd order central difference for
the spatial discretization with ∆t = 10−3 and uniform grid size ∆x = ∆y = 1/256.

Solve the set of simultaneous linear equations by the SOR method with over-relaxation
factor ω = 1.5 and convergence level ǫ < 10−8

Time integrate the equation until steady state is reached (ǫ < 10−8)

Solve the set of simultaneous linear equations by the following methods: (I)Jacobi, (II)GaussSiedel, (III)SOR, (IV)ILU, (V)SIP with α = 0.9, (VI)BiCGSTAB and (VII)BiCGSTAB
with SIP as preconditioner
